# Entertain Me

EntertainMe is a website for movie enthusiasts to be able to access key information about movies and leave their personal review for films they have watched.<br>
The benefit of the site is that it is an easy way for users to keep a log of movies they have watched. The simple search functionality means users can also quickly find and recall key movie information including actors and year of release. Having a log of your personal movie reviews is beneficial in a time when more of us are spending more time in front of our screens. You can easily recommend movies to friends based on your own personal review list. <br>

## Motivation
The movitivation for this project stemmed from COVID-19 and the increased number of people indoors and acessing streaming services to watch movies. 

We found that people, now more than ever, are engaging with content and recommending movies to their friends. We wanted to provide people with a way to remember the movies they had seen and keep an interactive log of their favourite movies or disliked movies to share their reviews with friends or keep for themselves.
